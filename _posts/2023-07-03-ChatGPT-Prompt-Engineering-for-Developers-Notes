# **Guidelines**
## **Principle 1**
Write clear and specific instructions:

- Tactic 1: Use delimiters like quotes, backticks, etc.
- Tactic 2: Ask for structured output like HTML, JSON
- Tactic 3: Check weather conditions are satisfied and check assumptions required to do the task (error handling)
- Tactic 4: Few-shot prompting - give successful example and then ask model to perform the task

## **Principle 2**
Give the model time to think:

- Tactic 1: Specify the steps to complete a task
- Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

# **Model Limitations**
## **Hallucination**
Makes statements that sound plausible but are not true

## **Reducing hallucinations:**
First find relevant information,
then answer the question based on the relevant information.

# **Notes on using the OpenAI API outside of this classroom**
<div class="mermaid">
To install the OpenAI Python library:

!pip install openai

The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key, which is available on the website.
You can either set it as the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable before using the library:

 !export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'

Or, set openai.api_key to its value:

import openai
openai.api_key = "sk-..."
</div>
